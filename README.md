## How to install redux library

## How to install [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/tree/master/docs)
```
npm i react-redux --save-dev

## Fetch to access web services
To fetch the items, we’re going to use the aptly named Fetch API. Fetch makes making requests much easier than the classic XMLHttpRequest and returns a promise of the resolved response (which is important to Thunk). Fetch isn’t available in all browsers, so you’ll need to add it as a dependency to your project with:

```
npm install whatwg-fetch --save
```

## [redux-thunl] (https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
Thunk middleware for Redux
```
npm install whatwg-fetch --save
```








```

# How to install redux library:

npm install --save redux


# How to install react-redux:

```
npm i react-redux --save-dev
```

# Fetch to access web services
To fetch the items, we’re going to use the aptly named Fetch API. Fetch makes making requests much easier than the classic XMLHttpRequest and returns a promise of the resolved response (which is important to Thunk). Fetch isn’t available in all browsers, so you’ll need to add it as a dependency to your project with:

```
npm install whatwg-fetch --save
```




```
Give examples
